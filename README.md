## About the Rachio Sprinklers plugin

This [Indigo](http://www.indigodomo.com/) plugin integrates [Rachio Sprinkler controllers](http://rachio.com) as standard [Indigo sprinkler devices](http://www.indigodomo.com/docs/overview#sprinkler_controls). Any Rachio device that is supported by [v1 of their API](https://rachio.readme.io/v1.0/docs) should work.

Check out the [full documentation](https://github.com/IndigoDomotics/rachio-indigo/wiki) for a complete description of how to use the plugin. You can always get the latest release directly from the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/IndigoDomotics/rachio-indigo/releases) or from the [Indigo Plugin Store](http://www.indigodomo.com/pluginstore/).
